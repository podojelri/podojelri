            <h1>Gyaru</h1>
            <p>
                Gyaru as a subculture has a long history in Japanese
                fashion. Although it is most commonly known by the rendition
                that peaked in the 1990s, it has actually existed in
                different forms since the creation of its name in 1968. [1]
                At its height in the 1990s, the style was popular with music
                groups and actresses. The style is known for its rebellious
                outfits that went against popular Japanese beauty standards,
                such as tanned skin and big hair. Although old looks were
                extreme, the style became less extreme as time went on. [2]
                Due to that, the gyaru subculture also started to categorize
                its members into kuro (dark) and shiro (pale) gyaru
                depending on the presence of a tan.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently, there has been a renewed interest in classic gyaru
                fashion due to a nostalgic Heisei boom, even resulting in a
                relaunch of the magazine Egg. [3][4]
            </p>
            <h3 id="tn">The Name</a></h3>
            <p>
                The name gyaru (ギャル) comes from a Japanese transliteration
                of the English slang word 'gal'. The term originated from a
                Levi Jeans commercial with the slogan "Levi's for Gals".
            </p>
            <h3 id="sb">Style Basics</h3>
            <p>
                Gyaru has many substyles, and many different variations in
                what can be considered gyaru or not. However, across almost
                all styles, there are some basic features that help to
                define the term "gyaru". [1]
            </p>

                Gyaru has many substyles, and many different variations in
                what can be considered gyaru or not. However, across almost
                all styles, there are some basic features that help to
                define the term "gyaru". [1]
            </p>
            <h4 id="h">Hairstyles</h4>
            <p>
                Classic gyaru hairstyles are big hair, whether teased, curled, 
                or with extensions. Generally, natural Western hair colors are 
                most popular. Blonde and light brown hair colors are the most 
                prominent. Although other colors, including unnatural colors, 
                can also be seen in some substyles.
            </p>
            <h4 id="a">Accessories</h4>
            <p>
                Gyaru accessories are numerous, but purposeful. Although gyarus 
                may accessorize more than other fashion styles, they
                never overcrowd or overwhelm the outfit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Popular accessories include long, false nails elaborately 
                decorated with bright colors and charms. Arm warmers, bangles,
                necklaces, and stylish hats or hair clip have also been popular 
                at one time or another.
            </p>
            <h4 id="s">Shoes</h4>
            <p>
                Heels and platform shoes of all types are most popular across 
                all types of gyaru. Some substyles will have flats or
                boots, but very rarely.
            </p>
            <h4 id="m">Makeup</h4>
            <p>
                Gyaru makeup is essential to completing a gyaru look. The large 
                eye look with false lashes and contact lenses is popular
                with gyaru, tanned skin is also popular in most style, and 
                heavier makeup with more noticeable eyeshadow, colored
                lipsticks, and blush. The amount of makeup will vary from style 
                to style, with more exaggerated styles using larger
                quantities of these things.
            </p>
            <h4 id="life"> Lifestyle </h4>
            <p>
                Gyaru has a lifestyle that has been attached to the style from 
                the very beginning. Although not all gyaru will participate in 
                all gyaru activities, most still remain popular with those who 
                wear the style. The main aspects of the gyaru lifestyle are a 
                focus on materialism, things such as having the newest phone to 
                take selfies with, and reading magazines on the latest styles. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Past gyaru activities have also included dancing parapara 
                (パラパラ) to Eurobeat music or Jpop, and various types of gyaru
                slang, called gyaru-go have also existed throughout the years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another essential part to the gyaru lifestyle is hanging out 
                with other gyaru, in what was called a "gal circle"
                (ギャルサークル). There were two types of types of gal circles 
                during gyaru's height, nagasa (長さ) which were casual groups to
                hang out with each-other and ibesa (イベサ) which would plan, 
                host, and have events with each-other. Nowadays with the
                decline in popularity of gyaru most gal circles have ceased 
                meeting. However, there are still a few active gal circles,
                such as the Manba gyaru group "Black Diamond".

            <p>
                Gyaru, because of its long history, has many substyles. Some are 
                more extreme, such as Manba, while others could pass more as 
                mainstream fashion, such as Bohemian gyaru. However, all of 
                these styles hold true to the core aspects of gyaru style.
